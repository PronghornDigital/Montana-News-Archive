# Preparing Your Library

Before we even get started putting things into the system, it's critical to get the physical media organized. When we take things off the shelves to digitize, we need to know where to put the items back, and how to find them again. Two things are critical here

* A **unique label**
* and **a permanent home**.

## Labels

Every pieces of media should have a unique label, outward facing and on the spine.

## A sensible grouping

Group your media in a place where it makes sense that you'll find it again. This could be either media that's labeled as a numbered series, a particular topic, or anything that will help you find it.

* When we start putting the media into the system, we'll call this a **family**.

### Rows, not stacks

Place your media in rows, not stacks. This is critical because it's so much easier when you grab media off and put it back, it's easier to be tempted to just place things back on top and get everything out of order.
