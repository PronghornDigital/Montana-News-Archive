# Welcome to Montana News Archive

This project is about saving our state's broadcast history for generations to come.

## What is it?

MTNA a system designed for small and medium broadcasters to index and catalogue their historical archives, and an eventual home towards digitization.

Specifically, it's an open-source web application, and this website provides instructions to stations on how to download and install the system for their own stations to use.

The application is specifically tailored to giving local broadcasters the tools they need to organize their historical materials with the following philosophy:

* **Step-by-step approach:** This system was designed with steps in place so that broadcasters can eat the proverbial elephant one bite at a time. Each step in the process provides a benefit, even if the system is not implemented to completion. No wasted time here.
* **Open-source code:** The code for the system is free to use and open-source.
* **Future-proof:** No system is future-proof, but all through the design process, we've been thinking about how to keep these broadcast materials — and the relevant metadata that's just as important — safe and accessible for years to come.

## Partners

This project is made possible through a partnership among the Greater Montana Foundation, the Montana Broadcaster's Association, KTVQ Billings, Third Cat LLC, and Pronghorn Digital.

## Availability

This program is expected to be available starting July 2016.
