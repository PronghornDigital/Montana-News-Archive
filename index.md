# Welcome to Montana News Archive

This project is about saving our state's broadcast history for generations to come.

## What is it?

Montana News Archive is a digital home for a local broadcast station's historical archives. 

It works as a self-hosted, open-source web application that gives stations the ability to index, catalog and organize their video files. This website provides instructions to stations on how to download and install the system for their own stations to use.

The application is specifically tailored to giving local broadcasters the tools they need to organize their historical materials with the following philosophy:

* **Step-by-step approach:** This system was designed so broadcasters can eat the proverbial elephant one bite at a time. Each step in the process provides a cognizable benefit, even if the system is not implemented to completion.
* **Open-source code:** The code for the system is free to use and open-source.
* **Future-proof:** No system is future-proof, but through the design process we've been thinking about how to keep these broadcast materials — and the relevant metadata that's just as important — safe and accessible for years to come.

## Partners

This project is made possible through a partnership among the Greater Montana Foundation, the Montana Broadcaster's Association, KTVQ Billings, the Montana History Foundation, Third Cat LLC, and Pronghorn Digital.
