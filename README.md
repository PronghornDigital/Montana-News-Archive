# Montana News Archive [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/PronghornDigital/Montana-News-Archive.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/PronghornDigital/Montana-News-Archive)

## Development
### The Easy Way
1. Install [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
2. Run `make local-dev`
3. Point your browser at localhost:8080 to see the running app.
4. Edit, Commit, and Dev on the files in your local directory as normal.

### The Old Way
1. Install [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
1. Install Node.js 4+
1. Create `./incoming` and `./data` for uploaded videos and psersistence, or
   configure `ARCHIVE_DATA_ROOT`
1. Install NPM dependencies
1. Run test suite
1. Start a webserver

```
nvm install 4 ; nvm alias default 4 # One-time thing to get the right Node.
cd path/to/project

mkdir incoming
# Alternatively, if you are uploading to a remote location, export this instead:
export ARCHIVE_INCOMING="/var/path/to/uploaded/vidoes"

npm install # The command shouldn't fail.
npm test # The tests should pass, and the command shouldn't fail.
npm start # The server will come up on localhost:8080, and print a banner.
```
## Deployment
In order to cut a new release, you must bump the version in `package.json`. Any merge into `master` that successfully passes testing in CI and has a bumped version in `package.json` will be packaged into an RPM and pushed as a [release artifact to GitHub][] under the tag matching this version. If you do not bump the version, the release will fail.

### CI
This project uses CIRCLE_CI for continuous integration. You must ensure that building of forks is disabled for security reasons. And you must ensure that the environment variable `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set to the value of an access token that has push privileges.

## Installation in Production
To make installation easier an install script is available to bootstrap your system. The script will download an RPM and then install the mtna package.

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PronghornDigital/mtna-server-cookbook/master/install.sh | bash
```
