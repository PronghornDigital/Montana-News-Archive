## Overview

This archive system is designed so that stations can implement it in incremental steps, with each step a manageable task that shows stations immediate benefit.

You can think of this in a couple phases:

## Preparing your Library

Before investing in the hardware or completing the data entry, we highly recommend organizing the tape and film as described in the [Preparing Your Library](/docs/preplibrary/) section. This can ensure that data entry can happen smoothly and accurately.

## Hardware & Software Set-up

The technical set-up guides will walk you through getting the right equipment and installing the software.

## Pictures and Scans

The first step to data entry is getting an image of every physical piece of media in a station's library. Ideally, this is done by scanning a tape index, but may also just be a photo of the piece of media to identify it.

## Initial Data Entry

News staff can then upload the pictures to the database, specifying dates for when the tape was in service. After this step, stations will be able to quickly identify tapes that were in service on a particular date.

## Details & Digitization

From this point on, stations will now have a digital home for their archives. The system allows for stations to attach digital video files and detailed story data. This can be done by stations on an as-needed basis, or they also may wish to systemize the digitization process.
