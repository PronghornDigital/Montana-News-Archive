## Server Setup

![Rackmount](/images/rackmount.jpg)

Stations will run the Montana News Archive software out of a computer in their building set up as a web server. 

You can set up an old PC or a get a new web server to use for this. 

You'll need to [download and install Fedora 24](http://www.tecmint.com/fedora-24-server-installation-guide/). During the installation process, set a root password (for this tutorial, we're using "toor" as a root password (It's just "root" backwards). You should set your own, better password, and whenever you see "toor," substitute your own password.

There's no need to create another user account.

You will also need to figure the server to use a **static ip address,** but the method for doing that will depend on your station's network.

Once you've got Fedora installed, you should see something like this. Note the IP address of the server, because you'll need it for the next step.
