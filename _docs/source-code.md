# Source Code Installation

This document will explain how to obtain and install the source code. This assumes the user has a basic understanding of how to install code on a server

## From the command line

Navigate to the directory where the program will run from:

1) Run `git clone`
2) Run `npm install`
3) `nvm default 4`
4) `npm test`
5) `ARCHIVE_DATA_ROOT=/var/archives npm start`

## Category Page Layout

"Place nested categories in a comma-delimited list" is a way of making sub-categories more compact on the Categories page. We recommend keeping the default (2 levels deep) in most cases.


## Organizing Categories

Drag and drop your categories to organize them! Slide them to the right slightly to tier them under the category directly above them.
