# Hardware Overview

Once the physical media library is organized, now's the time to acquire the hardware and configure it to install the software.

## Server

The software runs as a web application, so you'll need to acquire or designate a computer as a web server for the project. This must be running Fedora 24 in order to use these installation instructions, but advanced users who wish to chart their own course could use any flavor of Linux of OSX.

The technical requirements for the server are pretty minimal. Stations might want to get a rack-mounted server to fit in with the control room, but they may be able to get away with using an old workstation or even a laptop if they wish.

## Network-Attached-Storage Device

The data will be stored on a Network-Attached-storage Device, or NAS. We recommend getting one with multiple hard drives in a RAID configuration that will maintain the data will be safe in the event of a hard drive failure.

## Flatbed Scannner

A flatbed scanner will be used to scan tape indexes to upload to the database.
