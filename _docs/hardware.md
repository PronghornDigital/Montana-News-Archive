# Hardware Overview

Once storage area for the media is organized, now's the time to acquire the hardware and configure it to install the software.

## Server

The software runs as a web application, so you'll need to acquire or designate a computer as a web server for the project. This must be running either Linux, and we highly recommend Fedora 23, as we've automated the installation process to run on it.

## Network-Attached-Storage Device

The data will be stored on a Network-Attached-storage Device, or NAS. We recommend getting one with multiple hard drives in a RAID configuration that will maintain the data will be safe in the event of a hard drive failure.

## Flatbed Scannner

A flatbed scanner will be used to scan tape indexes to upload to the database.
