# Preparing Your Library

Before investing in the time to and expense to install the hardware, it's critical to get the physical media organized. This means getting things out of boxes and onto shelves, finding every recording a permanent home on a shelf somewhere.

There are two main things to keep in mind that every piece of media needs:

* A **unique label**.
* and **a sensible grouping**.

## Labels

Every piece of media should have a unique label, outward facing and on the spine.

## A sensible grouping

Group your media in a place where it makes sense that you'll find it again. This could be either media that's labeled as a numbered series, a particular topic, or anything that will help you find it. Think of it as a label that could mark the shelf the media sits on. In the example above, the grouping is the reporter's name.

* When we start putting the media into the system, we'll call this a **family**.

## Rows, not stacks

Place your media in rows, not stacks. This is critical because it's so much easier to keep tapes in order when it's in a row. Stacks are easily jumbled because it's so temping to place things on top, rather than the appropriate place.

## Being Prepared

As much of the media we're dealing with is decades-old, labels are going to fall off, tape will peel and film will break. Make sure that you have some clear tape and extra labels on hand to re-attach or replace labels when they fall off.
