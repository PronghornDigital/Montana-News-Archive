# Preparing Your Library

Before investing in the time to and expense to install the hardware, it's critical to get the physical media organized. This means getting things out of boxes and onto shelves, finding every recording a permanent home on a shelf somewhere.

There are two main things to keep in mind that every recording needs:

* A **unique label**.
* and **a permanent home**.

## Labels

Every pieces of media should have a unique label, outward facing and on the spine.

## A sensible grouping

Group your media in a place where it makes sense that you'll find it again. This could be either media that's labeled as a numbered series, a particular topic, or anything that will help you find it.

* When we start putting the media into the system, we'll call this a **family**.

## Rows, not stacks

Place your media in rows, not stacks. This is critical because it's so much easier to keep tapes in order when it's in a row. Stacks are easily jumbled because it's so temping to place things on top, rather than the appropriate place.
