# Obtaining Images of Physical Media

**First:** Have you [organized your library](/docs/preplibrary/)? Scanning indexes is easily systematized, but only if the physical shelves are organized in a way that the person doing the scanning can go straight down a row of shelves and put the tapes right back where he or she got them.

# Scanning indexes

The first step is to scan indexes or otherwise take pictures of the media. Even if you don't have an index we suggest taking pictures of the outside of the media, so that when using the database it's clear which tape or film reel the digital record relates to.

## Flatbed Scanner

A flatbed scanner tends to work the best for this task.

## What to include

Include as much information as possible in the image. For instance, in the example below we've put the spine and the index together in one image to make sure we know which index the tape goes to.

In this example, the index was taped as a booklet on the front of the tape. This was a little scary, because the more the tapes get handled, the greater the likelihood that the index will become detached. We cut the booklet off, taped it onto a single sheet of paper, and placed it inside the tape box after we scanned it:
