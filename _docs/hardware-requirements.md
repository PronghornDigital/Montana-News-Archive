## Server

The Montana News Archive app is a web application that can run on any computer installed with Linux. For the documentation, we'll be using a rackmount server with a fresh install of Fedora 23.

## Storage Device

All of the data will be stored on a network storage device. For this demonstration, we picked the QNAP RAID NAS.

## Flatbed Scanner

You'll need a flatbed scanner to scan in the tape indexes.
