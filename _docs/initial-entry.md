# Initial Entry

Once you have some images of physical media (ideally, in the form of scans of indexes), you can start adding those images to the database.

Now news staff will be able to browse through the archives straight from their computers.

**First,** open up a web browser and navigate to where your local archive system is hosted (contact the person who set up the system at your station if you have questions about where to find this.)

Click on the pink "new" button in the lower right-hand corner, and open up the folder on your computer where you have your scans.

## Data Entry

Refer to the image of the piece of media you're about to enter, and type in the following information:

**Label:** The label should be whatever the label says on the spine of the media. If it's sitting on a shelf, this is the name that's facing outward.

**Family:** This is a general grouping of tapes. You can think about this in terms of how the tape is stored in relation to the tapes around it. Whether it's by topic, by date era, by reporter or photographer, you can pick a family for the record that makes most sense for your archives.

**Medium:** Pick the medium of the recording.

**Start:** The date of the first story on the tape. Or, if you don't know, give it the widest possible range so that it will still show up if you're trying to search by date. For instance, if all you know about the tape is that it's from 1989, put Jan. 1 1989 as the start date.

**End:** The end date for the tape.

**Add Image:** Add a picture or a scan of the index for the media. This method is designed so that a station can rapidly enter data into the system. Rather than spend 20 minutes transcribing an index for stories that might not ever get used, reporters can browse through the index and decide to make notes of what matters.

## What you're seeing on the screen

Until you close the window, refresh the page, or conduct a search, you'll see all the records you've just created.
