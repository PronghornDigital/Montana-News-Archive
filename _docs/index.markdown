## Welcome!

Welcome to the documentation for the Montana News Archive system. These documents will help you figure out if this system is right for you and walk you through the steps to implement it.

## Who is this for?

The Montana News Archive system is for local broadcasters who have archival tapes and films, but lack an index to find the historical materials.

## What does it cost?

The software and documentation is free for all to use. The system will, however, require hardware and time investment to get up and running. More information on estimating how much it will cost and how long it will take to implement is available in information on the [pilot program](/pilot_program/) at KTVQ in Billings.
